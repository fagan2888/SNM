Code to accompany the working paper "Inference using simulated neural moments" which is in this archive as [SNM.pdf](https://github.com/mcreel/SNM/raw/master/SNM.pdf)

To replicate results, first, set JULIA_NUM_THREADS. Then edit RunProject.jl to select one of the examples, by uncommenting 
the relevant lines. CD to the directory of the chosen example, start Julia, and execute include("../RunProject.jl")
